# delc

Delete comments in C files (both classic C and C++ type comments)
in compliance with the 42 school standard. Useful if you want to
comment your code as much as you like without the hassle of having
to manually remove them when submitting a 42 project.

usage: delc [-h] [-s count] file ...
options:
	-h | --help:			print this
	-s | --skip count: 		delc will skip the 'count' first lines
							to avoid removing any header

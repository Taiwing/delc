- add an case to remove the first empty line when removing a comment on the
  first line with a skip of 0
- add options to only remove classic C comments or C++ comments
- maybe add recursivity
- maybe add an option to remove superfluous empy lines after delc is done (or
  when removing comments) (maybe even make it the default behaviour, with an
  option to deactivate it)
- maybe add an option to not remove white characters left when delc is done
  (seems useless to me, but who knows ?)
- maybe add an option to create copies of the files without affecting the
  originals (or an option to create backups of the original files)
- maaaaaaaybe handle pre-function comments (would probably add a lot of code)
